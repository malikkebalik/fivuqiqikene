Everyone has that one dream they can’t forget. Every time they close their eyes, it’s still vivid and evokes certain emotions that you don’t feel on a regular day. That dream, those memories play like a Tim Burton movie, painted on the canvas of my subconscious. It’s a place that raised me on its sheer beauty; its people have inspired me to be determined in the harshest of conditions. Living in the mountains taught me something sacrosanct for an actor — the art of being patient — as it’s no easy feat. Neither is starting out in our industry.”</p><p data-score=35><i><b>H!: Class</b></i><b> is your third OTT series after <i>Criminal Justice</i> (2019) and <i>Extraction</i> (2020).

It wasn’t sudden, and it definitely wasn’t planned. <i>Criminal Justice</i> was one of my first auditions in Mumbai. I auditioned for <i>Extraction</i> a year later, with no idea that it starred Chris Hemsworth in the lead. <i>Class </i>came about at the right time, when I was more aware of myself as an artist, more acquainted with the way the industry works. Also, with <i>Class</i>, I had finally arrived at something I always wanted to do — a teenage story, which is not a common genre in our film industry. So, in a way, it’s been a full-fledged journey.”</p><p data-score=22><b><i>H!:</i> You play the sweet, likeable character Dheeraj on the show.

They worked selflessly to raise us. Economically, it wasn’t that hard of a job to step into the shoes of a character who survives on a bare minimum.

Today, a lot of kids go through intense bullying and peer pressure, especially in international schools. There are a lot of unreal expectations of them. With the kind of person Suhani is, she is torn between two worlds. She doesn’t want to bend to peer pressure, but doesn’t know better at the same time. That’s what makes her who she is. As someone who went to an international school in Bengaluru, I felt I had insight into that world. I don’t come from an affluent background, so I understood both sides and wanted to tell Suhani’s story.”</p><p data-score=30><b><i>H!:</i> The show dramatically conveys the disparity between the haves and have nots. What was your takeaway from this experience?</b></p><p data-score=62><b><i>AS:</i></b> “This was a more impactful way of telling the story. To realise how some people are treated in this world was shocking for me, too. Walking through the streets where we were shooting, we saw the difference between lifestyles. It was important to shed light on these disparities.”</p><p data-score=26><b><i>H!:</i> While you’re part of a liberal, upmarket school in<i> Class</i>, what kind of schooling did you have?</b></p><p data-score=116><b><i>AS:</i></b> “My dad was in the Air Force, and when he retired, he joined an airline and wanted to give us a higher level of education. I transferred from a public school to an international school. We had a Wagon R, so I used to feel embarrassed when I’d see kids arrive in Mercs, BMWs and Audis. This was a new world for me and a culture shock. So I really understood where Suhani was coming from. I was the newbie and had classmates from affluent social circles who knew each other. I understood that alienating feeling, which helped me get into character.”</p><p data-score=24><b><i>H!:</i> Tell us a little about your experience at the shoot and the bonds you guys formed on the set.</b></p><p data-score=56><b><i>AS:</i></b> “We were part of an ensemble cast, but not all of us shot with each other. We shot the show over two years. Even though we’re all very different people, we’re united like a family. I don’t think we’ll ever experience this kind of bond again.”</p><p data-score=18><b><i>H!:</i> How did you land your debut role in 2022’s <i>Cobalt Blue</i>?</b></p><p data-score=75><b><i>AS:</i></b> “I auditioned for it in 2019. There were a lot of contenders for that role. I had a few meetings and screen tests to convince them to give me the part. I’m South Indian, whereas Anuja was Maharashtrian. I’m feminine, but she was gender neutral… I needed to work on these aspects, but I managed to get the part. I’m confident that way.”</p><p data-score=17><b><i>H!:</i> How do you let go after portraying such intense characters?</b></p><p data-score=75><i><b>AS:</b></i> “It varies from role to role. In my first on-screen performance as Anuja in Cobalt Blue, I had to work hard to get into character as she had a distinctive personality. That project was shot at a stretch. But with Suhani, it was a long-drawn process. I’m still new to this world, so I’ll find a process that will help me stay mentally well.”</p><p data-score=19><b><i>H!:</i> Where would you draw the line when it comes to intimate sequences?</b></p><p data-score=62><b><i>AS:</i></b> “An intimate scene is fine as long as I have a director I can trust, and there’s an intimacy coordinator on the set who’s trustworthy, unbiased and non-judgmental. If I know exactly what I’m doing, with whom, and I trust my partner, I’ll do whatever is best for the scene.”</p><p data-score=21><b><i>H!:</i> Your mother, Chitra Iyer, is a popular singer, and you enjoy singing, too...</b></p><p data-score=70><b><i>AS:</i></b> “Mum has been a singer her entire life. Her side of the family is musically inclined. We watched her perform constantly, and she often invited us to sing with her. This set the trend at an early age. I’ve also been performing with a contemporary jazz funk band called Bartender for eight years. It brings me true joy.”</p><p data-score=14><b><i>H!:</i> What is the real Anjali Sivaraman all about?</b></p><p data-score=46><b><i>AS:</i></b> “Unlike this glamorous woman you see, I’m shy, introverted and unbelievably awkward!

It was also a very different time; I was 14 back then, and there was no social media. People valued each other’s time, and conversations were more real. We weren’t glued to our phones all the time.”</p><p data-score=23><b><i>H!:</i> Veer Ahuja strikes us as a wimpish character witha conscience. What’s your opinion?</b></p><p data-score=109><b><i>ZS:</i></b> “Veer isn’t wimpish. And, of course, he has a conscience. I think Veer grew up in a ‘rich boy’ bubble. We grow up as a product of our surroundings and experiences. I’ve seen that myself. The people around you shape how your mind develops, to an extent. Veer’s dad is a criminal, and his sister is a drug addict. But he’s loyal, and his family comes first. I don’t think he’s classist either. If he were, he’d have never fallen in love with Saba. He’s just a confused kid with severe anger issues.”</p><p data-score=13><b><i>H!:</i> Who was your favourite on the set?</b></p><p data-score=71><b><i>ZS:</i></b> “This is a tough one. We’re all part of a big, dysfunctional family. We have each other’s back and love each other. I’m close with a lot of the cast members, including Anjali, Gurfateh Pirzada and Chintan Rachchh, but I’m closest with Chandan Anand. He also stayed with me for a few days, and we share a strong bond.”</p><p data-score=36><b><i>H!:</i> You switched from studying journalism at Suffolk University in Boston to acting at Lee Strasberg in New York. What made you gravitate towards acting?</b></p><p data-score=105><b><i>ZS:</i></b> “When I first went to university, I had no idea what to do. Coming from an affluent family in Delhi, it was expected of me to work with my parents on graduating, though I had no interest in that. I studied business management for two years, but I failed math so many times! I knew this wasn’t what I wanted to do with my life. Midway through college, I moved to PR, advertising and journalism, which I found more creative. I also tried to work in Boston, but a 9-to-5 desk job didn’t excite me.</p><p data-score=104>My parents have always been supportive, so I told my mum I wanted to drop out of business school and go to an acting school instead. Since she insisted I get my degree first, I waited till I graduated and then I went to Lee Strasberg. My first day was amusing, as I had never been around so many aspiring actors. I was nervous as they were all so well prepared. It really made me fall in love with acting. I enjoyed myself. And like my mum says: if you don’t enjoy what you do, drop it. It’ll never work out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/in.hellomagazine.com/images/0281-17f3d3159aac-50b554d8b212-1000/square-480/class-cast-interview.jpg><p data-score=12><b><i>H!:</i> How fashion conscious are you?</b></p><p data-score=76><b><i>ZS:</i></b> “My sister is super trendy and fashion forward. My mother is an interior designer, and my father has this swag. They all dress really well. And then there’s me. I don’t know why I never picked up on it, but fashion has never interested me. I’ve had three pairs of jeans and five T-shirts for the past six years. I wear the same thing every day!”</p><p data-score=13><b><i>H!:</i> What was your first day on set like?</b></p><p data-score=69><i><b>ZS:</b></i> “It was so scary! I only had a background in theatre and hadn’t seen so many large cameras before. I saw my name on my vanity van. It felt surreal. The first few days were brutal. I took way too many takes, but the director was (mostly) patient. After 15 days of shooting, I became comfortable and confident.”</p><p data-score=10><b><i>H!:</i> OTT or the big screen?</b></p><p data-score=44><i><b>ZS:</b></i> The big screen is like a dream, as I’ve always wanted to see myself on a movie poster.

There’s more range and so much more to work with. Also, to defend Yashika, she’s only a product of her environment. She wanted the scholarship, and this was the only way she had learnt to get her way. She’s young and doesn’t know any better. There’s a lot of room for growth…”</p><p data-score=13><b><i>H!:</i> Are you anything like your character?</b></p><p data-score=85><b><i>AK:</i></b> “I’m completely unlike Yashika. We don’t come from the same economic background. I think she has a lot to learn about life. She’s cool and intelligent and doesn’t have to feel pressured about fitting in. It consumes her. I care very little for those things. I do, however, admire her drive and relate to that immensely. She goes for what she wants. She’s a go-getter, and I am, too!”</p><p data-score=13><b><i>H!:</i> How different was your own schooling?</b></p><p data-score=69><b><i>AK:</i></b> “Oh, it was a stark contrast! I was a day scholar at a Parsi boarding school in Bandra, Mumbai. No one cared about how anyone looked or dressed. Every experience I had was veiled by rose-tinted glasses.

So I’ve had a good run, which will hopefully continue.”</p><p data-score=23><b><i>H!:</i> How different was your boarding school in Nainital from the elite institute on the show?</b></p><p data-score=98><i><b>CS:</b></i> “I’m an army brat and studied in military schools. But in Class 10, I transitioned to a private school. I faced a lot of bullying and stress here, and since it was a co-ed school, it was my first time meeting girls. So I could relate to my character, or even that of Dheeraj, because I had encountered these issues. You realise the class difference, that there are academic pressures and people wealthier than you. You tend to seek validation from others.”</p><p data-score=35><b><i>H!:</i> Balli seemed like a tough character to play, as it required a certain body language and rowdy lingo.

My agency set up an audition for Balli’s character. I liked the Haryanvi part and found him to be a complex character. There was a full arc. I was nervous about the intimate scenes, though. They sent me the intimacy script. I took 10 days to decide and was confirmed after three months.</p><p data-score=87>We had workshops for a few months. I used to call my Haryanvi friends to modulate my tone and even took a course with a coach. It was tough to shoot the intimate sequences, but we trusted our intimacy coach.
